# Console Commands
## Details
These commands are for people that wish to edit in-game values using the dev-console in the browser. If you have no experience with javascript, I would not suggest you use this as it can mess with the code of the game. Here is a list of commands for you to use in the console if you wish.
> ### Dev Note
> Despite being a game developer, I dont mind people modding my game, as long as it doesnt affect other people. If this game were ever to become an online game, then I would be against console commands. However since it is offline, the only thing you can edit is your own game. So I decided to give you a table of commands for you to do this so that you wouldn't waste time reading the source code.
## Table of Commands
| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| give(itemID) | This function allows you to give yourself any item. You pass in the item id of the item you want. It should then appear in your inventory if you have space. Be sure to pass the ID as a string. |
